</p>

The Renaissance Benchmark Suite aggregates common modern JVM workloads,
including, but not limited to, Big Data, machine-learning, and functional programming.
The suite is intended to be used to optimize just-in-time compilers, interpreters, GCs,
and for tools such as profilers, debuggers, or static analyzers, and even different hardware.
It is intended to be an open-source, collaborative project,
in which the community can propose and improve benchmark workloads.
